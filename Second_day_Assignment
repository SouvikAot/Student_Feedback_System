#practice question
# Create a tuple named product containing the following items: "Laptop", 50000, Black ,'Samsung' and "Electronics". Print the tuple.
 
# Access and print the second element of the tuple product.
 
# Slice and print the last two elements of the product tuple.
 
# Check whether "Electronics" is present in the product tuple and print a message.
 
 
# Create a tuple of 5 product prices: (1000, 1500, 1200, 1100, 900). Count how many times 1000 appears.
 
# Find and print the maximum and minimum price from the prices tuple.
 
# Use a loop to print each item from the product tuple on a new line.
 
 
# Convert the product tuple to a list. Change the price to 55000, then convert it back to a tuple. Print the updated tuple.
 
# Add a new item "In Stock" to the product tuple (simulate adding by concatenation).
 
# Remove "Electronics" from the product tuple (by converting to list, removing, and converting back).
 
 
# Unpack the tuple product into three variables and print each variable.
 
# Create a nested tuple that contains three product tuples inside it. Access and print the name of the second product in the nested tuple.
